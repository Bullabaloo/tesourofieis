Audiens autem Jesus, dixit eis: Inf\u00edrmitas h\u00e6c non est ad mortem, sed pro gl\u00f3ria Dei, ut glorific\u00e9tur F\u00edlius Dei per eam. Dilig\u00e9bat autem Jesus Martham et sor\u00f3rem ejus, Mar\u00edam, et L\u00e1zarum. Ut ergo aud\u00edvit, quia infirmab\u00e1tur, tunc quidem mansit in e\u00f3dem loco du\u00f3bus di\u00e9bus.

Dicunt ei disc\u00edpuli: Rabbi, nunc qu\u00e6r\u00e9bant te Jud\u00e6i lapid\u00e1re, et \u00edterum vadis illuc? Resp\u00f3ndit Jesus: Nonne du\u00f3decim sunt hor\u00e6 di\u00e9i? Si quis ambul\u00e1verit in die, non off\u00e9ndit, quia lucem hujus mundi videt: si autem ambul\u00e1verit in nocte, off\u00e9ndit, quia lux non est in eo. H\u00e6c ait, et post h\u00e6c dixit eis: L\u00e1zarus, am\u00edcus noster, dormit: sed vado, ut a somno \u00e9xcitem eum. Dix\u00e9runt ergo disc\u00edpuli ejus: D\u00f3mine, si dormit, salvus erit. D\u00edxerat autem Jesus de morte ejus: illi autem putav\u00e9runt, quia de dormiti\u00f3ne somni d\u00edceret. Tunc ergo Jesus dixit eis manif\u00e9ste: Lazarus m\u00f3rtuus est: et g\u00e1udeo propter vos, ut cred\u00e1tis, qu\u00f3niam non eram ibi: sed e\u00e1mus ad eum. Dixit ergo Thomas, qui d\u00edcitur D\u00eddymus, ad condisc\u00edpulos: E\u00e1mus et nos, ut mori\u00e1mur cum eo. Venit itaque Jesus, et inv\u00e9nit eum qu\u00e1tuor dies jam in monum\u00e9nto hab\u00e9ntem. (Erat autem Beth\u00e1nia juxta Jeros\u00f3lymam quasi st\u00e1diis qu\u00edndecim.)

Martha ergo, ut aud\u00edvit quia Jesus venit, occ\u00farrit illi: Mar\u00eda autem domi sed\u00e9bat. Dixit ergo Martha ad Jesum: D\u00f3mine, si fu\u00edsses hic, frater meus non fu\u00edsset m\u00f3rtuus: sed et nunc scio, quia, qu\u00e6c\u00famque pop\u00f3sceris a Deo, dabit tibi Deus. Dicit illi Jesus: Res\u00farget frater tuus. Dicit ei Martha: Scio, quia res\u00farget in resurrecti\u00f3ne in nov\u00edssimo die. Dixit ei Jesus: Ego sum resurr\u00e9ctio et vita: qui credit in me, etiam si m\u00f3rtuus f\u00faerit, vivet: et omnis, qui vivit et credit in me, non mori\u00e9tur in \u00e6t\u00e9rnum. Credis hoc? Ait illi: Utique, D\u00f3mine, ego cr\u00e9didi, quia tu es Christus, F\u00edlius Dei vivi, qui in hunc mundum ven\u00edsti. Et cum h\u00e6c dix\u00edsset, \u00e1biit et voc\u00e1vit Mar\u00edam, sor\u00f3rem suam, sil\u00e9ntio, dicens: Mag\u00edster adest, et vocat te. Illa ut aud\u00edvit, surgit cito, et venit ad eum: nondum enim v\u00e9nerat Jesus in cast\u00e9llum; sed erat adhuc in illo loco, ubi occ\u00farrerat ei Martha. Jud\u00e6i ergo, qui erant cum ea in domo et consolab\u00e1ntur eam, cum vid\u00edssent Mar\u00edam, quia cito surr\u00e9xit et \u00e9xiit, sec\u00fati sunt eam, dic\u00e9ntes: Quia vadit ad monum\u00e9ntum, ut ploret ibi. Mar\u00eda ergo, cum ven\u00edsset, ubi erat Jesus, videns eum, c\u00e9cidit ad pedes ejus, et dicit ei: D\u00f3mine, si fu\u00edsses hic, non esset m\u00f3rtuus frater meus. Jesus ergo, ut vidit eam plor\u00e1ntem, et Jud\u00e6os, qui v\u00e9nerant cum ea, plor\u00e1ntes, infr\u00e9muit sp\u00edritu, et turb\u00e1vit se\u00edpsum, et dixit: Ubi posu\u00edstis eum? Dicunt ei: D\u00f3mine, veni et vide. Et lacrim\u00e1tus est Jesus. Dix\u00e9runt ergo Jud\u00e6i: Ecce, qu\u00f3modo am\u00e1bat eum. Quidam autem ex ipsis dix\u00e9runt: Non p\u00f3terat hic, qui ap\u00e9ruit \u00f3culos c\u00e6ci nati, facere, ut hic non morer\u00e9tur? Jesus ergo rursum fremens in semet\u00edpso, venit, ad monum\u00e9ntum. Erat autem spel\u00fanca, et lapis superp\u00f3situs erat ei. Ait Jesus: T\u00f3llite l\u00e1pidem. Dicit ei Martha, soror ejus, qui m\u00f3rtuus fuerat: D\u00f3mine, jam fetet, quatridu\u00e1nus est enim. Dicit ei Jesus: Nonne dixi tibi, qu\u00f3niam, si cred\u00edderis, vid\u00e9bis gl\u00f3riam Dei? Tul\u00e9runt ergo l\u00e1pidem: Jesus autem, elev\u00e1tis sursum \u00f3culis, dixit: Pater, gr\u00e1tias ago tibi, qu\u00f3niam aud\u00edsti me. Ego autem sci\u00e9bam, quia semper me audis, sed propter p\u00f3pulum, qui circ\u00famstat, dixi: ut credant, quia tu me mis\u00edsti.

Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet dry with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. The sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick. But when Jesus heard this, He said to them, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that through it the Son of God may be glorified. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary, and Lazarus. So when He heard that he was sick, He remained two more days in the same place. Then afterwards He said to His disciples, Let us go again into Judea. The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, just now the Jews were seeking to stone You; and do You go there again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if he walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. These things He spoke, and after this He said to them, Lazarus, our friend, sleeps. But I go that I may wake him from sleep. His disciples therefore said, Lord, if he sleeps, he will be safe. Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought He was speaking of the repose of sleep. So then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead; and I rejoice on your account that I was not there, that you may believe. But let us go to him. Thomas, who is called the Twin, said therefore to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him. Jesus therefore came and found him already four days in the tomb. Now Bethany was close to Jerusalem, some fifteen stadia distant. And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them on account of their brother. When, therefore, Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him. But Mary remained at home. Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here my brother would not have died. But even now I know that whatever You shall ask of God, God will give it to You. Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise. Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise at the resurrection, on the last day. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he die, shall live; and whoever lives and believes in Me, shall never die. Do you believe this? She said to Him, \u2018Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, Who have come into the world. And when she had said this, she went away and quietly called Mary her sister, saying, The Master is here and calls you. As soon as she heard this, she rose quickly and came to Him, for Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. When, therefore, the Jews who were with her in the house and were comforting her, saw Mary rise up quickly and go out, they followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there. When, therefore, Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell at His feet, and said to him, Lord, if You had been her, my brother would not have died. When, therefore, Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her weeping, He groaned in spirit and was troubled, and said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see. And Jesus wept. The Jews therefore said, See how He loved him. But some of them said, Could not He Who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that this man should not die? Jesus therefore, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave and a stone was laid against it. Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, Lord, by this time he is already decayed, for he is dead four days. Jesus said to her, Have I not told you that if you believe you shall behold the glory of God? They therefore removed the stone. And Jesus, raising His eyes, said, Father, I give You thanks that You have heard Me. Yet I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people who stand round, I spoke, that they may believe that You have sent Me. When He had said this, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth! And at once he who had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with bandages, and his face was tied up with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go. Many therefore of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what He did, believed in Him.","id":"Evangelium","label":"Evangelho"},{"body":"*Sl 17:28, 32.*\nLowly people You save, O Lord, but haughty eyes You bring low; for who is God except You, O Lord?","id":"Offertorium","label":"Ofert\u00f3rio"},{"body":"May the gifts we offer, O Lord, cleanse us, we beseech You, that You may be always merciful to us.\nPor nosso Senhor.","id":"Secreta","label":"Secreta"},{"body":"*Pref\u00e1cio Comum*\n\u00c9 verdadeiramente digno e justo, racional e salutar render-Vos gra\u00e7as em todos os lugares e sempre, \u00f3 Senhor santo, Pai omnipotente, eterno Deus, por nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo.
