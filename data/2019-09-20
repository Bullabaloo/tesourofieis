And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, upon learning that He was at table in the Pharisee\ufffds house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment; and standing behind Him at His feet, she began to bathe His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed His feet, and anointed them with ointment. Now when the Pharisee, who had invited Him, saw it, he said to himself, This Man, were He a prophet, would surely know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner. And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Master, speak. A certain money-lender had two debtors; the one owed five hundred denarii, the other fifty. As they had no means of paying, he forgave them both. Which of them, therefore, will love him more? Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave more. And He said to him, You have judged rightly. And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house; you gave Me no water for My feet; but she has bathed My feet with tears, and has wiped them with her hair. You gave Me no kiss; but she, from the moment she entered, has not ceased to kiss My feet. You did not anoint My head with oil; but she has anointed My feet with ointment. Wherefore I say to you, her sins, many as they are, shall be forgiven her, because she has loved much. But he to whom little is forgiven, loves little. And they who were at table with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this Man, Who even forgives sins? But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.","id":"Evangelium","label":"Evangelho"},{"body":"*Sl 102:2, 5.*\nBless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits; and your youth shall be renewed like the eagle\ufffds.","id":"Offertorium","label":"Ofert\u00f3rio"},{"body":"May the gift of our fasting, we beseech You, O Lord, be acceptable to You, and by its purifying power make us worthy of Your grace and bring us to the eternal bliss You have promised us.\nPor nosso Senhor.","id":"Secreta","label":"Secreta"},{"body":"*Pref\u00e1cio Comum*\n\u00c9 verdadeiramente digno e justo, racional e salutar render-Vos gra\u00e7as em todos os lugares e sempre, \u00f3 Senhor santo, Pai omnipotente, eterno Deus, por nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo.
