Vade ergo in occ\u00farsum ejus, et dic ei: Recte ne \u00e1gitur circa te, et circa virum tuum, et circa f\u00edlium tuum? Qu\u00e6 resp\u00f3ndit: Recte. Cumque ven\u00edsset ad virum Dei in montem, appreh\u00e9ndit pedes ejus: et acc\u00e9ssit Gi\u00e9zi, ut amov\u00e9ret eam. Et ait homo Dei: Dim\u00edtte illam: \u00e1nima enim ejus in amarit\u00fadine est, et D\u00f3minus cel\u00e1vit a me, et non indic\u00e1vit mihi. Qu\u00e6 dixit illi: Numquid pet\u00edvi f\u00edlium a d\u00f3mino meo? Numquid non dixi tibi: Ne ill\u00fadas me?

Go therefore to meet her, and say to her: Is it well with you, and with your husband, and with your son? And she answered, Well. And when she came to the man of God to the mount, she caught hold on his feet: and Giezi came to remove her. And the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is in anguish, and the Lord has hid it from me and has not told me. And she said to him, Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say to you: Do not deceive me? Then he said to Giezi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand and go. If any man meet you, salute him not: and if any man salute you, answer him not: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. But the mother of the child said, As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. He arose therefore, and followed her. But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was not voice nor sense: and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not risen. Eliseus therefore went into the house, and behold, the child lay dead on his bed: and going in he shut the door upon him, and upon the child: and prayed to the Lord. And he went up and lay upon the child: and he put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and he bowed himself upon him: and the child\ufffds flesh grew warm. Then he returned, and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he went up and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes. And he called Giezi, and said to him, Call this Sunamitess. And she being called, went in to him. And he said, Take up your son.
