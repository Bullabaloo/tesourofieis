In crast\u00ednum autem turba multa, qu\u00e6 v\u00e9nerat ad diem festum, cum aud\u00edssent, quia venit Jesus Jeros\u00f3lymam, accep\u00e9runt ramos palm\u00e1rum, et process\u00e9runt \u00f3bviam ei, et clam\u00e1bant: Hos\u00e1nna, bened\u00edctus, qui venit in n\u00f3mine D\u00f3mini, Rex Isra\u00ebl. Et inv\u00e9nit Jesus as\u00e9llum, et sedit super eum, sicut scriptum est: Noli tim\u00e9re, f\u00edlia Sion: ecce, Rex tuus venit sedens super pullum \u00e1sin\u00e6. H\u00e6c non cognov\u00e9runt disc\u00edpuli ejus primum: sed quando glorific\u00e1tus est Jesus, tunc record\u00e1ti sunt, quia h\u00e6c erant scripta de eo: et h\u00e6c fec\u00e9runt ei. Testim\u00f3nium ergo perhib\u00e9bat turba, qu\u00e6 erat cum eo, quando L\u00e1zarum voc\u00e1vit de monum\u00e9nto, et suscit\u00e1vit eum a m\u00f3rtuis. Propt\u00e9rea et \u00f3bviam venit ei turba: quia audi\u00e9runt eum fec\u00edsse hoc signum. Pharis\u01fdi ergo dix\u00e9runt ad semet\u00edpsos: Vid\u00e9tis, quia nihil prof\u00edcimus? Ecce, mundus totus post eum \u00e1biit. Erant autem quidam gent\u00edles ex his, qui asc\u00e9nderant, ut ador\u00e1rent in die festo. Hi ergo access\u00e9runt ad Phil\u00edppum, qui erat a Beths\u00e1ida Galil\u01fd\u00e6: et rog\u00e1bant eum, dic\u00e9ntes: D\u00f3mine, v\u00f3lumus Jesum vid\u00e9re. Venit Phil\u00edppus, et dicit Andr\u00e9\u00e6: Andr\u00e9as rursum et Phil\u00edppus dix\u00e9runt Jesu. Jesus autem resp\u00f3ndit eis, dicens: Venit hora, ut clarific\u00e9tur F\u00edlius h\u00f3minis. Amen, amen, dico vobis, nisi granum frum\u00e9nti cadens in terram m\u00f3rtuum f\u00faerit, ipsum solum manet: si autem m\u00f3rtuum f\u00faerit, multum fructum affert. Qui amat \u00e1nimam suam, perdet eam: et qui odit \u00e1nimam suam in hoc mundo, in vitam \u00e6t\u00e9rnam cust\u00f3dit eam. Si quis mihi min\u00edstrat, me sequ\u00e1tur: et ubi sum ego, illic et min\u00edster meus erit. Si quis mihi ministr\u00e1verit, honorific\u00e1bit eum Pater meus. Nunc anima mea turb\u00e1ta est. Et quid dicam? Pater, salv\u00edfica me ex hac hora. Sed propt\u00e9rea veni in horam hanc. Pater, clar\u00edfica nomen tuum. Venit ergo vox de c\u0153lo: Et clarific\u00e1vi, et \u00edterum clarific\u00e1bo. Turba ergo, qu\u00e6 stabat et aud\u00ederat, dicebat ton\u00edtruum esse factum. Alii dic\u00e9bant: Angelus ei loc\u00fatus est. Resp\u00f3ndit Jesus et dixit: Non propter me h\u00e6c vox venit, sed propter vos. Nunc jud\u00edcium est mundi, nunc princeps hujus mundi ejici\u00e9tur foras. Et ego si exalt\u00e1tus f\u00faero a terra, \u00f3mnia traham ad me\u00edpsum. - Hoc autem dicebat, sign\u00edficans, qua morte esset morit\u00farus. - Resp\u00f3ndit ei turba: Nos aud\u00edvimus ex lege, quia Christus manet in \u00e6t\u00e9rnum, et qu\u00f3modo tu dicis: Oportet exalt\u00e1ri F\u00edlium hominis? Quis est iste F\u00edlius hominis? Dixit ergo eis Jesus: Adhuc m\u00f3dicum lumen in vobis est.

For on his account many of the Jews began to leave them and to believe in Jesus. Now the next day, the great crowd which had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took the branches of palms and went forth to meet Him. And they cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel! And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion; behold, your King comes, sitting upon the colt of an ass. These things His disciples did not at first understand. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and that they had done these things to Him. The crowd therefore, which was with Him when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness to Him. And the reason why the crowd also went to meet Him was that they heard that He had worked this sign. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do you see that we avail nothing? Behold, the entire world has gone after Him! Now there were certain Gentiles among those who had gone up to worship on the feast. These therefore approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus. Philip came and told Andrew; again, Andrew and Philip spoke to Jesus. But Jesus answered them, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it brings forth much fruit. He who loves his life, loses it; and he who hates his life in this world keeps it unto life everlasting. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am there also shall My servant be. If anyone serves Me, My Father will honor him. Now my soul is troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour! No, this is why I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name! There came therefore a voice from heaven, I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again. Then the crowd which was standing round and had heard, said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to Him. Jesus answered and said, Not for Me did this voice come, but for you. Now is the judgment of the world; now will the prince of the world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to Myself. Now He said this signifying by what death He was to die. The crowd answered Him, We have heard from the Law that the Christ abides forever. And how can You say, \ufffdThe Son of Man must be lifted up\ufffd? Who is this Son of Man? Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness may not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light. These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them.",
