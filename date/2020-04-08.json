Et factus in ag\u00f3nia, prol\u00edxius or\u00e1bat. Et factus est sudor ejus, sicut gutt\u00e6 s\u00e1nguinis decurr\u00e9ntis in terram.

Adhuc eo loqu\u00e9nte, ecce turba: et qui vocab\u00e1tur Judas, unus de du\u00f3decim, anteced\u00e9bat eos: et appropinqu\u00e1vit Jesu, ut oscular\u00e9tur eum. Jesus autem dixit illi: J. Juda, \u00f3sculo F\u00edlium h\u00f3minis tradis? C. Vid\u00e9ntes autem hi, qui circa ipsum erant, quod fut\u00farum erat, dix\u00e9runt ei: S. D\u00f3mine, si perc\u00fatimus in gladio? C. Et perc\u00fassit unus ex illis servum pr\u00edncipis sacerd\u00f3tum, et amput\u00e1vit aur\u00edculam ejus d\u00e9xteram. Resp\u00f3ndens autem Jesus, ait: J. S\u00ednite usque huc. C. Et cum tetig\u00edsset aur\u00edculam ejus, san\u00e1vit eum. Dixit autem Jesus ad eos, qui v\u00e9nerant ad se, pr\u00edncipes sacerd\u00f3tum et magistr\u00e1tus templi et seni\u00f3res: J.

Et interv\u00e1llo facto quasi hor\u00e6 un\u00edus, \u00e1lius quidam affirm\u00e1bat, dicens: S. Vere et hic cum illo erat: nam et Galil\u00e6us est. C. Et ait Petrus: S.

Et viri, qui ten\u00e9bant illum, illud\u00e9bant ei, c\u00e6d\u00e9ntes. Et velav\u00e9runt eum et percuti\u00e9bant f\u00e1ciem ejus: et interrog\u00e1bant eum, dic\u00e9ntes: S.

At illi dix\u00e9runt: S. Quid adhuc desider\u00e1mus testim\u00f3nium? Ipsi enim aud\u00edvimus de ore ejus. C. Et surgens omnis multit\u00fado e\u00f3rum, dux\u00e9runt illum ad Pil\u00e1tum. C\u0153p\u00e9runt autem illum accus\u00e1re, dic\u00e9ntes: S. Hunc inv\u00e9nimus subvert\u00e9ntem gentem nostram, et prohib\u00e9ntem trib\u00fata dare C\u00e6sari, et dic\u00e9ntem se Christum regem esse. C. Pil\u00e1tus autem interrog\u00e1vit eum, dicens: S. Tu es Rex Jud\u00e6\u00f3rum? C. At ille resp\u00f3ndens, ait: J. Tu dicis. C. Ait autem Pil\u00e1tus ad pr\u00edncipes sacerd\u00f3tum et turbas: S. Nihil inv\u00e9nio caus\u00e6 in hoc h\u00f3mine. C. At illi invalesc\u00e9bant, dic\u00e9ntes: S. C\u00f3mmovet p\u00f3pulum, docens per univ\u00e9rsam Jud\u00e6am, inc\u00edpiens a Galil\u00e6a usque huc. C. Pil\u00e1tus autem \u00e1udiens Galil\u00e6am, interrog\u00e1vit, si homo Galil\u00e6us esset. Et ut cogn\u00f3vit, quod de Her\u00f3dis potest\u00e1te esset, rem\u00edsit eum ad Her\u00f3dem, qui et ipse Jeros\u00f3lymis erat illis di\u00e9bus. Her\u00f3des autem, viso Jesu, gav\u00edsus est valde. Erat enim c\u00fapiens ex multo t\u00e9mpore vid\u00e9re eum, eo quod aud\u00ederat multa de eo, et sper\u00e1bat signum \u00e1liquod vid\u00e9re ab eo f\u00ederi. Interrog\u00e1bat autem eum multis serm\u00f3nibus. At ipse nihil illi respond\u00e9bat. Stabant autem pr\u00edncipes sacerd\u00f3tum et scrib\u00e6, const\u00e1nter accus\u00e1ntes eum. Sprevit autem illum Her\u00f3des cum ex\u00e9rcitu suo: et ill\u00fasit ind\u00fatum veste alba, et rem\u00edsit ad Pil\u00e1tum. Et facti sunt am\u00edci Her\u00f3des et Pil\u00e1tus in ipsa die: nam \u00e1ntea inim\u00edci erant ad \u00ednvicem. Pil\u00e1tus autem, convoc\u00e1tis princ\u00edpibus sacerd\u00f3tum et magistr\u00e1tibus et plebe, dixit ad illos: S. Obtul\u00edstis mihi hunc h\u00f3minem, quasi avert\u00e9ntem p\u00f3pulum, et ecce, ego coram vobis int\u00e9rrogans, nullam causam inv\u00e9ni in h\u00f3mine isto ex his, in quibus eum accus\u00e1tis. Sed neque Her\u00f3des: nam rem\u00edsi vos ad illum, et ecce, nihil dignum morte actum est ei. Emend\u00e1tum ergo illum dim\u00edttam. C. Nec\u00e9sse autem hab\u00e9bat dim\u00edttere eis per diem festum, unum. Exclam\u00e1vit autem simul univ\u00e9rsa turba, dicens: S. Tolle hunc, et dim\u00edtte nobis Bar\u00e1bbam. C. Qui erat propter sediti\u00f3nem quandam f\u00e1ciam in civit\u00e1te et homic\u00eddium missus in c\u00e1rcerem. Iterum autem Pil\u00e1tus loc\u00fatus est ad eos, volens dim\u00edttere Jesum. At illi succlam\u00e1bant, dic\u00e9ntes: S. Crucif\u00edge, crucif\u00edge eum. C. Ille autem t\u00e9rtio dixit ad illos: S. Quid enim mali fecit iste? Nullam causam mortis inv\u00e9nio in eo: corr\u00edpiam ergo illum et dim\u00edttam. C. At illi inst\u00e1bant v\u00f3cibus magnis, postul\u00e1ntes, ut crucifiger\u00e9tur. Et invalesc\u00e9bant voces e\u00f3rum. Et Pil\u00e1tus adjudic\u00e1vit f\u00ederi petiti\u00f3nem e\u00f3rum. Dim\u00edsit autem illis eum, qui propter homic\u00eddium et sediti\u00f3nem missus f\u00faerat in c\u00e1rcerem, quem pet\u00e9bant: Jesum vero tr\u00e1didit volunt\u00e1ti e\u00f3rum. Et cum d\u00facerent eum, apprehend\u00e9runt Sim\u00f3nem quendam Cyren\u00e9nsem, veni\u00e9ntem de villa: et imposu\u00e9runt illi crucem port\u00e1re post Jesum. Sequeb\u00e1tur autem illum multa turba p\u00f3puli, et mul\u00ederum, qu\u00e6 plang\u00e9bant et lamentab\u00e1ntur eum. Conv\u00e9rsus autem ad illas Jesus dixit: J. Fili\u00e6 Jer\u00fasalem, nol\u00edte flere super me, sed super vos ipsas flete et super f\u00edlios vestros. Qu\u00f3niam ecce v\u00e9nient dies, in quibus dicent: Be\u00e1t\u00e6 st\u00e9riles, et ven\u00edres, qui non genu\u00e9runt, et \u00fabera, qu\u00e6 non lactav\u00e9runt. Tunc inc\u00edpient d\u00edcere m\u00f3ntibus: C\u00e1dite super nos; et c\u00f3llibus: Oper\u00edte nos. Quia si in v\u00edridi ligno h\u00e6c f\u00e1ciunt, in \u00e1rido quid fiet? C. Duceb\u00e1ntur autem et alii duo nequam cum eo, ut interficer\u00e9ntur. Et postquam ven\u00e9runt in locum, qui voc\u00e1tur Calv\u00e1ri\u00e6, ibi crucifix\u00e9runt eum: et latr\u00f3nes, unum a dextris et \u00e1lterum a sin\u00edstris. Jesus autem dicebat: J. Pater, dim\u00edtte illis: non enim sciunt, quid f\u00e1ciunt. C. Divid\u00e9ntes vero vestim\u00e9nta ejus, mis\u00e9runt sortes.

Illud\u00e9bant autem ei et m\u00edlites acced\u00e9ntes, et ac\u00e9tum offer\u00e9ntes ei, et dic\u00e9ntes: S. Si tu es Rex Jud\u00e6\u00f3rum, salvum te fac. C. Erat autem et superscr\u00edptio scripta super eum l\u00edtteris gr\u00e6cis et lat\u00ednis et hebr\u00e1icis: Hic est Rex Jud\u00e6\u00f3rum. Unus autem de his, qui pend\u00e9bant, latr\u00f3nibus, blasphem\u00e1bat eum, dicens: S. Si tu es Christus, salvum fac temet\u00edpsum, et nos. C.

Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows: and we have thought him as it were a leper, and as one struck by God and afflicted. But he was wounded for our iniquities, he was bruised for our sins: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned aside into his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was offered because it was his own will, and he opened not his mouth: he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and shall be dumb as a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open his mouth. He was taken away from distress, and from judgment: who shall declare his generation? because he is cut oh out of the land of the living: for the wickedness of my people have I struck him. And he shall give the ungodly for his burial, and the rich for his death: because he hath done no iniquity, neither was there deceit in his mouth. And the Lord was pleased to bruise him in infirmity: if he shall lay down his life for sin, he shall see a long-lived seed, and the will of the Lord shall be prosperous in his hand. Because his soul hath laboured, he shall see and be filled: by his knowledge shall this my just servant justify many, and he shall bear their iniquities.

And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation. And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling down, he prayed, Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer. And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground. And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow. And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation. As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him. And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss? And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword? And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him. And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs? When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them. Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him. But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not. And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not. And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean. And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew. And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter going out, wept bitterly. And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him. And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee? And blaspheming, many other things they said against him. And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us. And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me. And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go. But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God. Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am. And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth. AND the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate. And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king. And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it. And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man. But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place. But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee? And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days. And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing. And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him. And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another. And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people, Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him. No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. I will chastise him therefore, and release him. Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day. But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison. And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus. But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go. But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed. And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus. And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us. For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry? And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots. And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil. And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise. And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost. (Here kneel, and pause\nAnd behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man, The same had not consented to their counsel and doings; of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.",
